# Traffic Monitoring System with YOLO 🚦

This project is an AI-powered **Traffic Monitoring System** using **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection and vehicle tracking.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)
- Python & OpenCV
- Deep Learning & Computer Vision

## 📊 Features
✔️ Detects & classifies vehicles in real-time  
✔️ Tracks movement across frames  
✔️ Optimized for accuracy & performance  

## 🚧 Facing File Size Issues on GitHub?
While pushing this project to **GitHub**, I encountered **file size limits (100MB per file)**. The **output video file was too large**, so I uploaded the project to **Google Drive** instead.

📂 **Project Files:** [[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LDGSDNwpSDCQMip7kls9NSDTNLJ4tnfT?usp=sharing)

## 📩 How to Use
1. Download the files from the above link.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the model with `python detect.py`.

Let's connect and collaborate on AI projects! 🚀
